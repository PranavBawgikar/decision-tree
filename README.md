<h1 align="center">Python Decision Tree Classifier</h1>

This project contains a Python implementation of a decision tree classifier. The decision tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences to classify data.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and effective way to classify data using the decision tree algorithm.

In this project, the decision tree classifier is tested on both the training and testing data sets using the X and Y variables, and the accuracy score is printed along with a confusion matrix to display the results.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To use the decision tree classifier in your own projects, you'll need to follow these steps:

Open the Google Colab notebook that contains the decision tree classifier code.

Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed. This may include libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, which are commonly used in machine learning projects. You can install these libraries using the following commands:




```
!pip install numpy

!pip install pandas

!pip install scikit-learn
```
